# Conflict in Colombia

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to a data analyzer and visualizer program.

## Respository structure

- The folder [code](/code/) contains the code of this project.
- The folder [documentation](/documentation/) contains the repository documentation files about this project.
- The folder [data](/data/) contains the data source for this project and neccesary files.

## Context

In this project we have some government data about demobilizations and armed groups in Colombia, the intention is to analyze and treat this set of data to respond to some requirements.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Implement algorithms to build and traverse matrices.
- Use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries.

## How does it work?

Once you execute the application, the options will be displayed by the console and you can start to navegate and interact with the program with the console. The responses will be showed in a [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) window or in the console.

The file [consola_desmovilizados.py](/code/consola_desmovilizados.py) has one function for each requirment executing the neccesary functions from the file [desmovilizados.py](/code/desmovilizados.py) that help to solve the requirments.

You need to have installed [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) libraries.


## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [consola_desmovilizados.py](/code/consola_desmovilizados.py) file.

Before any other option, in each execution you have to execute the option 0 to load the data file and be able to continue with the others. Once you execute the option 0 you should type the data file name, it is "estadisticas".

Before execute the option 7, 8, 9 and 10 you have to execute the option 6 due to this option create a data strucuture necessary por the next options.

To exit of the program type any other character not available in the options list.
